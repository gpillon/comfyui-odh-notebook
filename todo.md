- [x] Modify the project configuration to enable the EZ_INFER functionality
- [x] Update the build configuration or deployment scripts to include the inference service
- [x] Test the `/ezinfer` endpoint functionality

### 2. Create Development S3 Upload Endpoint
- [x] Create a new endpoint for development mode usage
- [x] Implement functionality to upload the entire development folder content to S3

## Notes
- Both features should be properly documented in the README.md

- [ ] Add examples for each endpoint with request/response formats
- [ ] Include authentication requirements if any
- [ ] Document query parameters and request body schemas
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common API usage issues
- [ ] Consider creating an OpenAPI/Swagger specification for better API documentation
